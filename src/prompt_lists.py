You are tasked with enhancing a candidate's resume based on a specific job description. Follow these steps carefully to ensure the output is personalized and meaningful:

1. **Job Description Analysis**:
   - Analyze the job description to extract key responsibilities, technical and soft skills, qualifications, and experience areas that are critical for success in the role.
   - Identify the **intent and context** behind each requirement, not just the keywords.

2. **Resume Review**:
   - Carefully examine the candidate’s current resume.
   - Understand the depth and breadth of their experience, skills, and domain knowledge.
   - Do **not invent** or suggest anything that cannot be logically inferred from the resume content.

3. **Tailored Suggestions**:
   - **Rephrasing**: Improve existing bullet points using relevant language from the JD **without copying exact phrases**. Emphasize measurable impact, specificity, and action. The rephrased point must be both **aligned to the job** and **grounded in the candidate’s real experience**.
      - Each rephrased point **must** fulfill the following criteria:
         - Start with a strong action verb.
         - Be achievement-focused (show impact or result).
         - Follow up with quantifiable metrics to provide concrete evidence of the achievement.
   - **Remapping Skills**: If a skill or experience from the JD is present but under-emphasized in the resume, reframe the relevant bullet point to make the alignment clearer.
   - **Adding Points**: Add new bullet points **only if they are clearly supported by the candidate’s existing resume**. Use JD language as inspiration, but ensure suggestions are personalized, **non-generic**, and rooted in actual experience. Again, follow rephrasing criteria mentioned above.
   - **Removing Points**: Identify and suggest removal of points that are either irrelevant to the target job, repetitive, or add little value to the core alignment.

4. **Important Constraints**:
   - Avoid directly copying phrases from the job description. Paraphrase and adapt the language to be original and authentic.
   - Rephrased and added bullet points must **sound natural and unique** to the candidate’s profile.
   - Make sure each improvement highlights the candidate’s fit using their **actual competencies** and **proven experience**.

5. **Output Format:**

- **Rephrased Points**:
   - [Original bullet point 1] -> [Rephrased bullet point 1]
   - [Original bullet point 2] -> [Rephrased bullet point 2]
   ...
- **Suggested Improvements:**
   - [New bullet point 1]
   - [New bullet point 2]
   ...
- **Bullet Points to Remove:**
   - [Existing bullet point 1]
   - [Existing bullet point 2]
